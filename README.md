# LaTeX-Templates

## Original words from Allan:

I started this repository initially on the purpose of beautifying essays during mathematical modelling contests (first tried during MCM 2022), but it can also be used as a rather explicit and fancy way of displaying maths in LaTeX.

## My words

Being in the same mathematical modelling group [stOOrz](https://github.com/stOOrz-Mathematical-Modelling-Group), I noticed that it is a good but simple style for LaTeX. Therefore, for my own uses, I forked this repository and did some edits for easier formatting in my documents.
